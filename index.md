## Projects:

#### Pig Stack:

Coming Soon for iOS and Android!

#### Tweet Generator:

FrEECS Tweet Generator is a machine learning program written in Python. It takes in any public twitter handle and outputs a realistic tweet for that handle.

User experience is provided by a GUI built using Tkinter and realistic tweet boxes.

The program was originally written for the final project of the Elemetary Programming Concepts course, and its team of 4 won first place at the showcase put on by the course as voted by the viewing companies.

Since then, FrEECS Tweet Generator has been Dockerized. Try now!

```bash
docker build --name FrEECS .
docker run FrEECS
```
